## Bio
I am a postdoctoral researcher (and Young Investigator) at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org) and the University of Washington, advised by Prof. Yejin Choi.
I completed my PhD in Natural Language Pocessing at the [NLP lab of Bar Ilan University](https://biu-nlp.github.io), supervised by Prof. Ido Dagan and Prof. Reut Tsarfaty. I also was a visiting PhD student at [UW NLP](https://nlp.washington.edu) and had the pleasure of interning twice at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org). My work has been awarded an [ACL Outstanding Paper Award](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16786) and the ACL [Best Theme Paper Award](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00838). I am also very honored to have received the [AI2 Outstanding Intern of the Year Award](https://allenai.org/outstanding-interns).
Previously I did a research internship at Google, obtained an MSc from the University of Edinburgh and a BA from the University of Zurich.

## Research
My research focuses on post-training and the adaptation of Language Models, in order to make them better semantic and pragmatic reasoners. In the past, I worked on question generation, natural language representations, and discourse. I am also interested in underspecified, ambiguous and implicit language and in teaching language models how to better deal with such phenomena. More specifically, my research is centered around:
<ul>
  <li><b>Post-Training and LM Adaptation:</b> Finding optimal recipes for LM post-training - from analyzing preference data to algorithms.</li>
  <li><b>Natural Language Understanding:</b> Deeper semantic reasoning across a broader discourse and better handling of ambiguity and underspecification for LLMs.</li>
  <li><b>Critical Evaluation:</b> Testing LMs' abilities to perform pragmatic inferences, extracting their implicit values, and evaluating Reward Models.</li>
</ul>

### Misc
Besides this I love rowing (currently at Lake Washington Rowing Club) and going to the "cinemathèque". My Erdős number is 3 (Paul Erdős → Noga Alon → Ido Dagan → Me) and my Kevin Knight number is 2 (Kevin Knight → Yejin Choi → Me).
