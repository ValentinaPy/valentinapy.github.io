<b>I am on the academic job market for faculty positions!</b> *Feel free to reach out if you have an opening in your department* .

I am a postdoctoral researcher (and Young Investigator) at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org) and the University of Washington, advised by Prof. Yejin Choi.
I completed my PhD in Natural Language Pocessing at the [NLP lab of Bar Ilan University](https://biu-nlp.github.io), supervised by Prof. Ido Dagan and Prof. Reut Tsarfaty. I also was a visiting PhD student at [UW NLP](https://nlp.washington.edu) and had the pleasure of interning twice at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org). My work has been awarded an [ACL Outstanding Paper Award](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16786) and the ACL [Best Theme Paper Award](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00838). I am also very honored to have received the [AI2 Outstanding Intern of the Year Award](https://allenai.org/outstanding-interns).
Previously I did a research internship at Google, obtained an MSc from the University of Edinburgh and a BA from the University of Zurich. 
DanaÃ« Metaxa is Raj and Neera Singh Term Assistant Professor at the University of Pennsylvania in the [Computer and Information Science department][penncis], with a secondary appointment in the [Annenberg School for Communication][pennasc]. Along with [Andrew Head][amh], they are the co-founder and co-leader of the [Penn HCI group][pennhci]. 

In their research, Dr. Metaxa studies **bias and representation in algorithmic systems and content**, focusing on high-stakes social settings like politics and employment, and on marginalized groups. Recently, their group has been developing [**sociotechnical auditing**][sta], an algorithm/AI auditing method that combines traditional auditing with user-centered behavioral science interventions, to understand how algorithmic systems and their end users impact each other.

Prior to joining Penn, Dr. Metaxa was a postdoctoral scholar with the Stanford [Center of Philanthropy and Civil Society's][pacs] [Program on Democracy and the Internet][pdi], and a Ph.D. candidate in [Computer Science][stanfordCS] at Stanford University.
